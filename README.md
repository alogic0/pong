# Pong game, [try it!] (http://alogic0.github.io/pong)

This is modification of the game from the original Elm example
http://elm-lang.org/edit/examples/Intermediate/Pong.elm

Mouse control added, instead of a keyboard arrows, for moving paddles faster and with more accuracy. You can play with code too by pasting content of the Pong.elm file into the interactive editor and compiler here http://elm-lang.org/try
